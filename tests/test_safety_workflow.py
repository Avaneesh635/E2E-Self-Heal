"""Pin the properties #291 requires of the safety benchmark workflow.

The workflow cannot run in the unit-test environment (it needs a model key, a browser and a
CI runner), so these tests guard the parts that must not regress silently: it never blocks,
it is skipped without credentials, and it does not expose a secret to forked pull requests.
